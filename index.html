    <h1>6 packs in 30 days</h1>
    <h2>Rock your core with our month-long plan of abs workouts</h2>

    <p>Keeping yourself in good shape is a lifelong endeavour, which is why it’s important to find an activity you love so sticking with it becomes easy. However, while maintaining your long-term health and fitness requires a consistent approach to training and some achievable goals you can tick off along the way, there’s still a place for short-term challenges. You’ll be amazed at what you can achieve in just 30 days, and completing a challenge like the one below might even be the motivational boost you need to spark a longer-term commitment to looking after your fitness.
        <br>      <br>
        Before we get to the long term, however, let’s consider the next 30 days, which are all planned out for you. This challenge is designed by Taofique Folarin (who was a trainer at boutique gym Sweat It London when he set it), who has created a month of workouts that are sure to sculpt a more defined set of abs as well as increasing your core strength. You might not finish the 30 days ready to show off a perfect six-pack, but you’ll find that your posture and mobility have improved, and that you have more power in the tank when playing sport or lifting weights.
        <br>      <br>
        Over the 30 days you’ll have just four days of rest, with all other days involving core exercises or a HIIT workout. You’ll find all the info you need to complete the plan below, and because your life might feel like it’s missing something once the challenge ends, we have recommended more great abs workouts further down the page to help fill the void.

    <h3>How To Do This 30-Day Abs Challenge</h3>
    <P>“This challenge not only targets all parts of the abdominals but also works your core endurance,” says Folarin. “It builds in intensity, allowing you to notice your improvements every day, until you have mastered each exercise by day 30.”
        <br>
        The workouts use only bodyweight exercises so you can do them anywhere and any time you have a spare moment, making it easier to stick to the plan whatever life throws at you. Even better, the exercises are suitable for all fitness levels.

    <h3>More Abs Workouts</h3>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Upper abs, lower abs and obliques circuits
</h4>
    <br><br>
    <p>This trio of circuit workouts cover every part of your abs and are the perfect way to progress your core training if you finish the 30-day challenge desperate for more. You can do the upper abs and obliques workouts without any equipment, but you will need a pull-up bar for the lower abs circuit. 

</p>

    <h4>Dumbbell abs workout

</h4>
    <br><br>
    <p>If you have a single dumbbell to hand, put it to good use with this quick and effective core workout. You’ll be doing six circuits of five moves, resting only at the end of each round to keep your core muscles working hard for a sustained period.
</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    
                               <br><br><br>
    <h4>Lower abs workout

</h4>
    <br><br>
    <p>If you have aspirations to carve out a six-pack it’s vital that you spend time focusing on the lower abs or you’ll end up with a beautifully defined four-pack. This tough session uses a mix of hanging exercises (you can use gym rings or a pull-up bar) and floor moves to put your lower abs to work.
